what object orientation?
------------------------
 - Based on objects, which consists of 
	- State (data,held in fields)
	- Behavior (methods, functions)
	
 - The state is hidden from other objects
 	- data is accessed through the object's own methods.
 
 - An OO program is a collection of objects working together.
 
why object orientation?
-----------------------
 - Almost universal in the s/w industry.
 
 - useful for analysis, design and coding.
 
 - most successful for managing complexity.
 	- Supports decoupling of subsystems.
 	- Encourages reuse if components.
 	
 - Design rationale for much of java language.
 
 What's wrong with Global Data structures
 ----------------------------------------
  - Responsibility for state becomes spread out
  
  - Different subsystems are coupled together.
  
  - Difficulty representing varied data formats.
  
  - Extremely difficult to parallelize.
  
 
 Example : flight  height  bearing  speed
  			F-1      32      276    450
  			F-2      30      376    850
  			
  		- we can access private data using getters and setters.
  		- Encapsulation protects the object's fields from external access. 
  		
 Use cases
 ---------
 	- Scenarios of system operation
 	- often started by a human user
 	- list the sequence of interaction steps.
 
 Example - order control system
 
 1. Create order and check out - customer creates an order by first adding various products
 	(digital or physical) to a shopping cart, then checks out, making a payment using a credit card.
 	
 2. Fulfill order - for an order, the system discovers which distribution centers hold
    stock of the products in the order. Each center which can help fulfill the order is
    sent details of the products required together with the customer's details.
    
 Use Cases -> Domain Model which consists of Conceptual Classes -> Software classes
 
 Discovering a Conceptual Classes
 --------------------------------
  - A Customer creates an order by first adding various products(digital or physical)
    to a shopping cart, then checks out, making a payment using a credit card.
    
    - Customer
    - Order
    - Product
    - Shopping Cart
    - Payment
    - Credit Card
    
 Class Relations
 ---------------
         
         (Composition)
  	Customer (1) - "has-a" - (1) credit card
  	
   
   	Product - "is-a" - 1.digital product
                       2.physical product
                       
                       
 	         (Aggregation)
 	Shopping cart - (1) - "has-a" - (*) Product
 	
 	
 Software classes
 ----------------
 - A customer checks out, making a payment using a credit card.
 
 	customer ------------------- Credit card
 	   |
 	name : string				number : long
 	creditCard : CreditCard 	CreditCard(long)
 	Customer(string, long)
